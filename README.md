# Handwriting-Recognition


READ ME FILE

This is a deep learning project for handwriting recognition where I have used various architecture like ANN, CNN, and Le_net5 to arrive at models with high accuracy and precision . I have used the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is one of the most commonly used dataset for training various image processing systems and machine learning algorithms.MNIST has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.

DATA USED: val.txt,train.txt,test.txt and MNIST preloaded data.
I also have a report which explains the results from Part 2 to 7 below

1. Project 1 Milestone included doing Data Processing which includes standardization and one hot encoding. After that I have tried to fit models like KNN,Ada Boost,SVM in the MNIST dataset to check which method is giving the least erros. 

2. In Project 1_Part_1.ipynb I have created  single layer nerual network and plotted its misclassifiation and cross validation error. (Consists of question 3,4,5,6 . It also consists of Question 7 First Favourite Model .)

3. In Project 1_Part_1.ipynb I also created a CNN with  nerual network and plotted its misclassifiation and cross validation error.

4. In Project 1_Part_1.ipynb I also created a CNN with  nerual network and dropout and plotted its misclassifiation and cross validation error.
5. In Project 1_Part_1.ipynb I also created a CNN with 2convulation layer   nerual network and dropout and plotted its misclassifiation and cross validation error.

6. In MODEL2_PART1.ipynb I used Le-Net5 (Consists of Part a,b,c of the second favourite model of Question 7)

7. In Model2_part2.ipynb I continued creating Le-net5




Error:
In the beginning I have printed and attached the name valid accuracy. However that means Valid misclassification and not accuracy
