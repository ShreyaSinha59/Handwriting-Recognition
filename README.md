# Handwriting-Recognition


READ ME FILE
This is a deep learning project where I have used various architecture like ANN, CNN, and Le_net5 to arrive at models with high accuracy and precision .
DATA USED: val.txt,train.txt,test.txt and MNIST preloaded data.
Files:
1. Project_Part_1.ipynb: Consists of question 3,4,5,6 . It also consists of Question 7 First Favourite Model .
2. MODEL2_PART1.ipynb : Consists of Part a,b,c of the second favourite model of Question 7
3. Model2_part2.ipynb : Consists if Part d of the second favourite model of Question 7.
Apart from this I also have a report
Error:
In the beginning I have printed and attached the name valid accuracy. However that means Valid misclassification and not accuracy
